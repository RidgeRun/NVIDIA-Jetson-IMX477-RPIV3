# NVIDIA Jetson IMX477 HQ RPI V3 camera driver

This driver has been developed by NVIDIA Corporation, RidgeRun Engineering and Leopard Imaging Inc. as a collaborative initiative in order to release the first version of the Sony IMX477 sensor driver for the Raspberry Pi HQ camera.

Supports the following Jetson platforms:
* Jetson Xavier NX
* Jetson Nano

## Repository structure

```
where:

* `4.5_*_imx477-v0.1.0.patch` is the patch to be applied on the JetPack 4.5 sources in order to add support for the IMX477 camera sensor in the Jetson Xavier NX and Jetson Nano.
* `series` is a file containing the patch name in order to apply it by using the quilt tool.
* `camera_overrides.isp` is a file which contains a set of calibration parameters for the Image Signal Processor of the HQ camera.

## JetPack installation instructions

You can download and install the JetPack by following the instructions below:

## Driver Installation instructions

There are two options to install the driver:

### OPTION A: Installing the kernel and dtb debians (Recommended)

This is the easiest and fastest way to install the driver. In order to install the debian packages you just need to perform the following instructions:
